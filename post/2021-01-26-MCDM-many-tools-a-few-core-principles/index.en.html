<h2>MCDM Disciplinary Applications Growing Exponentially</h2>
<p>There is an exponential growth in the use of MCDA tools across many industries. Although much of the core theory and principles have been discussed for decades, the accessibility of powerful desktop computing means that computationally intensive methods can be applied to everyday decisions. For example, choosing a hotel, flight, new car or house is now routinely aided by websites that implement MCDA, statistical or AI algorithms. Theoretically, these daily decisions can be more objective than the pencil and paper methods of the past.</p>
<p>Perhaps not widely recognized is the fact that all the bells and whistles of web-based decision engines are still implementing a nearly constant set of principles and, to varying degree, correcting for known flaws in human decision making.</p>
<p>This post recalls the basic principles – often written as steps – for MCDM or MCDA.</p>

<p>The principles of MCDA are embodied in simple methods. (Note that purists in decision analysis criticize MCDA methods as sometimes incomplete) For example, matrix methods are fairly intuitive (e.g. [Haimes 1998]).</p>
<ul>
<li>List all decision criteria (attributes).</li>
<li>Assign weights to the attributes (Sum = 1).</li>
<li>List all the policy options.</li>
<li>For each policy option, multiply the rank of the attribute by the corresponding weight of the attribute.</li>
<li>Sum the products for each policy option.</li>
<li>Select the best policy option.</li>
</ul>
