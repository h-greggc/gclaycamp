## The title markdown: 
`` title:  Conquering Math in Markdown \( y=x^2\\\) ``


### Some inline math

Here is paragraph with a simple inline equation using ``\\(`` and ``\\)`` in the code: \\( y=x^2+c \\). The markdown is simply: 
``
 \\(y=x^2+c \\)
``
### A block equation

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$
<br> 
   


\\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\\]
