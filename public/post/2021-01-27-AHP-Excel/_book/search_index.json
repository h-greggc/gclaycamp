Beginning decision matrix example Gregg Claycamp 2021-01-13 0.1 Spreadsheet software is broadly accessible Most data scientists and statisticians I know groan at the prospect of creating or performing data automation and analysis in popular spreadsheet platforms, such as Excel, Google Sheets and others. For example, the automation tools have long been based in either recorded cell formulas or Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). More rigorous compiled programming could be accomplished using Visual Studio languages including VB, C# and C++. More recently, Javascript and Typescript have been added to Excel and Sheets; however, limitations in in their uses remain, such as a file size limit in web-based Excel macros. In spite of apparent unpopularity for statistical programming and data chores, desktop spreadsheet software remains popular due to its broad accessibility to users. Not only are spreadsheet programs available on almost every desktop, laptop and tablet produced, but the documentation and training opportunities for beginning to advance users are ubiquitous. 0.2 Basic Decision Matrix We will develop a simple decision suitable as a foundation to multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). Decision matrices are a basic and intuitive approach to choosing one alternative among many based the performance of the alternative across the criteria. The matrix approach is useful for a range of simple decisions from personal to corporate choices. We will begin with a common decision of choosing a new car. For example, I might want to choose a new car given some criteria, including Cost, Safety, Capacity, Fuel Economy and Style. Note that I can identify a laundry list for the attributes of contemporary cars; however, we will see throughout the Excel examples that an exhaustive list is not necessarily helpful in finding a useful alternative.1 Keeney (1992) discusses the need to thoroughly identify possible alternatives in an important decision making process for important and complex decisions. But, listing every possible new car as an alternative would clearly be overkill for this decision problem. AN intuitive process of applying criteria to create a shorter list is often used. For example, the cost of new cars can quickly shorten the list.  "]]
