In this post I compare quantitative features of\rCOVID-19 with H1N1 and other flu-like illnesses, Ebola virus disease (EVD), and SARS to show differences between COVID-19 and the flu. Of course, this is not the first time these comparisons have been made in public media; rather, this post is only my perspective on the issue.\nThere are several ways in which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and some recent other pandemics can be compared. Sometimes, the endpoints for comparing the pandemic are cherry-picked to support the individual‚Äôs or organization‚Äôs purpose. But generally speaking, quantitative comparisons of pandemics begin using fundamental measures, such as\n\rthe number of cases,\rthe number of deaths, and\rthe population size.\r\rAlthough these pandemic measures start with the seemingly simple process of counting cases and deaths, the luxury of that simplicity is seldom achievable. Each numerical comparison is nuanced and sometimes even specific to which outbreak of complex disease. The field of epidemiology‚Äìthe study of diseases in populations‚Äìuses these fundamental measures to derive more specific measures of incidence, prevalence, and risk (Below). Trained infectious disease scientists and clinicians seldom made casual comparisons using only the above terms, but instead, carefully state the assumptions and possibly caveats necessary to make scientifically valid comparisons using an array of terms. For this post, we‚Äôll assume that such simplifying assumptions and caveats could be easily resolved.\nComparing the number of cases\rThe number of cases (‚Äúcase counts‚Äù) is a basic measure used to routinely monitor diseases in addition to detecting an emerging epidemic disease.1 The following figure (Fig.1) shows the worldwide case counts for the past SARS, EVD and H1N1 (Swine Flu) outbreaks and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Note that the horizontal axis is a logarithmic scale, e.g., moving in powers of 10 (10, 100, 1000, 10000, ‚Ä¶). If not shown that way, the tens of millions of cases in COVID-19 and H1N1 would visually swamp the thousands-fold fewer cases of Ebola and SARS. (You would need a very wide monitor to display the graph!)\n\rDeath Counts Tell a Different Story\rThe total deaths due to the outbreaks are shown in Fig. 2. Here I dropped the log scale to show the dramatic differences among the past and ongoing outbreaks. For example, the SARS outbreak from a coronavirus, disappears as a significant cause of worldwide mortality.\nThe data reported during and after an outbreak is likely to include the proportion of cases or deaths in the population. Sometimes these proportions are called the ‚Äúnormalized cases (or deaths).‚Äù At the simplest level, these proportions are simply the number of cases/deaths divided by the size of the population of concern. Because populations of interest in epidemiology are often large, the ratio is adjusted to the ‚Äúnumber of cases/deaths per 100,000 in the population.‚Äù For example, if we found 200 cases in a population of 250,000 people, the normalized cases are:\n\\[ N^*=\\frac{200 \\ cases}{250,000 \\ people}=0.0008\r\\]\rThis mathematical result, while certainly correct, leaves us with trying to imagine a 0.0008 illness. Thus, we can bring the proportion back to the realm of whole people by multiplying the proportion by 100,000:\n\\[\rn^*=0.0008 \\ times \\ 100000 = 80\\ cases \\ per \\ 100,000 \\ people\r\\]\r‚ÄúNormalizing‚Äù the case/death counts by population size makes sense for the comparison of the intensity of an outbreak from one administrative boundary to the next. For example, if the administrative boundary is \" county\" and the example is compared with a second county also having 200 cases of disease but a population size of 1M, then the normalized comparison is 80 versus 20 cases per 100,000. Clearly, the counties that were apparently equal in case counts now are 4-fold different in the normalized case counts.\n\rHigher Order Measures in Outbreaks\rThe base counts are seldom sufficient for making comparisons among outbreaks and pandemics. For example, if we look at only total case counts, then we have only a cumulative counting measure that begins at the index (first) case and ends some period of time later when no new cases are observed. But the rate of accumulation of new cases might be more relevant to public health planning because it informs the rate at which health services will be needed for case management. There are several higher order or derived measures of an outbreak that are more useful for understanding not only the population disease process itself, but also the possible demand on health care resources. Such derived measures include, among others:\n\rincidence (incidence rate; incidence proportion)\rprevalence\rperson-years at risk\rcase fatality ratio\rinfectivity\rvirulence\rmodes of transmission\r\rA short blog is not suited for carefully defining all of these terms and then using them to compare outbreaks. I recommend online sources including basic epidemiology text published by CDC.2 We will continue our simplified comparison of outbreaks with only a few key measures.\n\rComparing the case fatality ratios\rThe case fatality proportion (also called the case fatality ratio or rate) is a basic measure of great importance in infectious disease epidemiology. The measure gets right to the point of, ‚Äúhow lethal is this disease?‚Äù It is typically defined as the number of cases of a disease that end in death from a specific cause divided by the total number of cases of that disease in a defined population. This endpoint is used colloquially to express the risk of death, given that the individual has the disease. In other words, what percentage of true cases are expected to die? Using the case fatality ratio (CFR) is where the comparisons of the major outbreaks is turned on its head: now, the relatively low risk of having Ebola virus disease (EVD) looks much worse because, given the patient has EVD, the likelihood of death is about 40%! By comparison, the relative chance of death, given an H1N1 infection is 400 times less than the risk of death from EVD. We will visit more characteristic of case fatality ratios in a later post; but for now, look at Fig. 3 for the remarkable differences among the CFRs the pandemics in question.\n\rOther Comparisons\rInfectivity and Modes of Transmission\rViral infectivity is the ability of a pathogen to establish infection. Virulence is a measure that is really at the interface between the environment‚Äìair, water, other fluids and solid surfaces‚Äìand the host. In other words, if the viral particles are in the air that the host breathes, what is the likelihood that the host will be infected? Viral infectivity is correlated (positive) with the virulence of the virus. Although we might attempt to compare the infectivity of the three outbreaks in the abstract, in fact, the modes of transmission are different, complicating a simple comparison. The coronavirus causing SARS and COVID-19 are clearly transmitted primarily by inhalation of contaminated air, whereas the infection by Ebola virus is through contact with bodily fluids, tissues and contaminated surfaces from an EVD patient.\n\rDerived measures\rPrevalence and incidence are two classical epidemiology measurements that are derived from the number of cases or deaths. The first of these‚Äìprevalence‚Äì is the proportion of cases in a defined population at a fixed time point. The ‚Äúdefined population‚Äù is central to both the epidemiology of a single outbreak and the comparison of different outbreaks and from possibly different viruses. Defined population can be based on administrative boundaries, e.g., the population within a county, state, country or continent; or, the definition might be a specific age group with other characteristics. The wide range of possible definition makes prevalence-based a potential minefield of errors.\nThe incidence or incidence rate of disease is also difficult to use in comparisons across types of outbreaks. Incidence refers to the number of new cases in a defined population of susceptible hosts over a set period of time (e.g., ‚Äúper year‚Äù). Incidence rates suffer from the same challenges of the related prevalence of disease.\n\r\rOutbreak measures can and do change\rWhile it might appear that the fundamental measurements in epidemiology, cases and deaths, can be easily tallied, in fact the true number of cases/deaths in an outbreak can be difficult to obtain and might not even be known for several years after the outbreak!3 This happens because the signs and symptoms for many infectious diseases are overlapping, and might even overlap with those of the infected person‚Äôs pre-existing conditions. If there is no way to clearly identify the infectious agent, then the clinician diagnoses the disease by comparing with a current knowledge base of signs and symptoms. With a novel disease like COVID-19, the scientific and regulatory communities will debate the exact definition of a COVID-19 case in the midst of the pandemic because the ‚Äúrecognized‚Äù signs and symptoms are likely to change with more experience.\nIn conclusion, I have shown that just a few simplistic comparisons using basic epidemiologic measures can easily dispel the notion that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is ‚Äújust like the annual flu.‚Äù A deeper dive into the specifics of infectivity, virulence, age-dependency and co-morbidities would take volumes to discuss in even moderate depth. More importantly, the knowledge base on COVID-19 is rapidly evolving due to the efforts of scientists and public health officials to gather and share data. As Dr.¬†Anthony Fauci remarked recently, understanding the long-term effects of COVID-19 is a ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù4.\n\r\rBoth chronic and infectious diseases are counted on a regular basis as part of public health risk management.

For both studies, the microclimate, atomization pressure, inlet air volume, product temperature (during spraying and curing), curing time, and percent solids in the coating solutions were studied. The responses evaluated were percent agglomeration, percent fines, percent yield, bead aspect ratio, median particle size diameter (d50), assay, and drug release rate.

Replacing binder source did not statistically influence the quality attributes of the granules and tablets. However, lubricant type has significantly impacted the granule size. Blend uniformity, crushing force, disintegration time during the manufacturing was predicted using validated PLS regression models with acceptable standard error of prediction (SEP) values, whereas the models resulted in higher SEP for batches obtained from different manufacturing site.

Quantitative risk assessment methods in design and operational spaces are a significant aid to evaluating proposed design space boundaries. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate a relatively simple strategy for design space definition using a simplified Bayesian Monte Carlo simulation. This paper builds on a previous paper that used failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) qualitative risk assessment and Plackett-Burman design of experiments to identity the critical quality attributes. The results show that the sequential use of qualitative and quantitative risk assessments can focus the design of experiments on a reduced set of critical material and process parameters that determine a robust design space under conditions of limited laboratory experimentation. This approach provides a strategy by which the degree of risk associated with each known parameter can be calculated and allocates resources in a manner that manages risk to an acceptable level.","tags":["QRM","Quality Risk Management","Quality by Design"],"title":"Quality-by-Design II: Application of Quantitative Risk Analysis to the Formulation of Ciprofloxacin Tablets","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Working Paper","MCDA","project teams","QRM","Quality Risk Management","uncertainty"],"content":"h1{ padding: 20px !important;\rmargin: 0px !important;\rline-height: 45px;\rfont-size: 45px;\r}\r\rIntroduction\r\r\r\r\rThis post is about the need for working groups and teams to define their decision objectives whenever the decision is important for accomplishing the group‚Äôs goals. Group decision making is where ‚Äúa group of two or more individuals must collectively select an alternative from a set of two or more alternatives that best satisfies the group‚Äôs objectives, and no individual has veto power‚Äù (Keeney 2013). Important decisions are typicallly complex, having multiple objective and subjective attributes that serve as criteria for choosing the among two or many alternatives. The process of multicriteria decision making (MCDM) is well suited for finding an objective solution for complex decisions. Although the first step in MCDM or MCDA processes is to clearly define the overall objective that the decision maker or decision making group wishes to accomplish, it is often a neglected or poorly executed. Here, I discuss signs and symptoms of a weak MCDM process due to inattention to defining a clear objective.\nClear Decision Objectives are Essential\r\r\r\r\rSometimes weeks or months into a team‚Äôs decision making process, debate around the meaning of the decision objective(s) arises possibly stalling the team‚Äôs progress. Essentially, different perceptions about the charge among team members creates uncertainty around the team‚Äôs decision-making purpose or even the question, ‚Äúwhy are we here?‚Äù The team‚Äôs uncertainty can feed on itself until the team finds it necessary to request tath the decision owner restate her objective(s) to the working group. In other situations, the decision making team might reach a decision recommendation under an assumed shared understanding of the objectives only to be told that from the decision owner‚Äôs perspective, the team answered the wrong question! If this is a frequent occurrence, the organization will soon have only reluctant volunteers for ad hoc and resilience and efficiency of the organization can be adversely impacted.\n‚ÄúThe achievement of objectives is the sole reason for being interested in any decision.‚Äù (see (Keeney 1992); p.¬†55). Keeney‚Äôs succinct statement or similar statements appear frequently in decades of MCDM literature. Yet I believe that many decision coaches and advisers will report that the most common problem in an individual‚Äôs or team‚Äôs decision making process is the lack of clearly-stated decision objectives. The decision objective(s)‚Äìthe *reason(s) for the decision‚Äî*are sometimes not carefully articulated even for critical tactical and strategic decisions. The results of MCDM in the absence of a clear objective is often disappointment and frustration with formal decision making processes.\nEveryone knows the objective!\r\r\r\r\rThink about your experience working in groups or teams who are charged with finding solutions to complex problems, such as developing new information or prioritizing among projects in the organization‚Äôs tactical plan. Did the group discuss and articulate the main objective, or was the objective ‚Äúhanded down‚Äù from the decision owner (e.g., senior management) in the form of a committee charge or a problem statement? The decision objective(s) might be well understood and part of both the culture and business process in most routine decisions. But novel scenarios lead to top-down decision objectives that can be nuanced and vague due to a manager‚Äôs concern for appearing to dictate a decision process and‚Äìworse‚Äìthe choice. These are the team decision making scenarios that we are most interested in understanding and improving, so-called ‚ÄúCategory II‚Äù decisions that are ‚Äúnonroutine, nonrecurring and uncertain of outcome‚Äù(Harrison 1999). The remainder of this blog post focuses on the difficult, multicriteria and sometimes, multi-objective, decisions that take us hours, weeks and even years to decide. In those ‚Äústuck‚Äù decisions, a clear articulation of the decision objectives is crucial to achieve a lasting and satisfying team decision. I will return to these explanations along with others after first reviewing the elelments of a complex team decision and decision making process.\nDecision making by teams\r\r\r\r\rThe team‚Äôs work is focused around specific tasks typically organized on a strategic objective.\nImportant decisions, whether at the board, managerial, or operational level, are often accomplished by groups of decision makers. (I will refer to these decision making groups as ‚Äúteams‚Äù whether or not they are either standing or ad hoc teams.) Examples of team decision making are very diverse including decisions\n within strategic planning, selecting a leadership candidate, choosing supplier(s), choosing new sites and prioritizing risk management resources.  Depending on a team‚Äôs function, their decisions can be thought of as either strategic or tactical. Although strategic decisions might follow a formalized decision making process including a facilitator or decision coach, tactical decisions, such as ‚Äúchoose a new supplier,‚Äù likely rely on informal team decision making. In other instances, a tactical team might be charged by a manager with advising management on choosing a new site or even allocating resources for risk and quality manufacturing. Such decisions benefit from‚Äìif not require‚Äìa more formal decision making process.\nTeam composition\r\r\r\r\rTeams are comprised of individuals who are likely to have a differing perspectives on the problem at hand. Although increasing the team size for diversity of experience, knowledge, disciplines and skills among members can improve the generation of decision objectives and alternatives, it comes at a cost of decreasing individual participation in the exercise (Chapman 1998).\nComplex decisions have both objective and subjective inputs, sometimes many alternatives and conflicting attributes. Describing an individual‚Äôs preferences among for how objective and subjective inputs factor into a final choice‚Äìgiven uncertainties‚Äìis the subject of classical decision analysis. But classical decision analysis is difficult to extend to several or many decision makers. Nevertheless, useful concepts from decision analysis inform analogous processes in team-based MCDM. This is supported by a significant body of empirical reports on ‚Äúwhat works‚Äù in group decision making. Finally, the applicability of methods, such as MCDA, to group decision making has fueled a nearly exponential growth in tools and applications since the 1990s.\nMore data for decision making?\r\r\r\r\rModern organizations have remarkable access to data and knowledge management tools which can be used to inform both strategic and tactical decisions including the allocation of resources to address risk. Although data and knowledge management contribute to reducing uncertainty in decision making, they neither define nor eliminate uncertainties and risks impacting the achievement of a desired objectives. multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) has evolved as a structured way to define decision objectives and combine the various inputs into objectively quantifying the decision.\nIt is paradoxical that greater accessibility to data and information can both complicate and improve team decision making. A few keystrokes in a contemporary internet search can lead to hundreds of pages of data and information about buying cars. Although the volume of information can be daunting, in fact, thoughtful analysis of the information likely improves the quality of decision making by reducing uncertainty. The volumes and different types of information make MCDM challenging enough for a single decision-maker; and, adding multiple decision makers to the process only amplifies the complexity. As Keeney outlined across multiple publications, the reasons for inherent complexity include (Keeney 2004, 2012):\n  Team members view their common decision differently;\n  Even if the team agrees on the alternatives and consequences, the members may assign different chances to events;\n  Consensus or similar shared decision policies mean that team member‚Äôs perspectives of the decision and evaluation of the alternatives must be incorporated in the overall decision.\n  Proponents of multicriteria decision analysis argue that many of the challenges within group decision making can be overcome by following processes that have their roots in applied decision analysis, such as the ProACT procedures (Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa 2002) and value-focused thinking (Keeney 1992) discussed in the following paragraphs.\nThere are many ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù books in the trade and peer-review literature discussing individual decision making. One of the most useful and accessible books is Smart Choices (Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa 2002). The book is an excellent introduction to decision making with multiple criteria. The authors recommended a ‚ÄúProACT/URL‚Äù process for these difficult decisions as described in the following table.\n         Problem Work on the right decision problem   Objective Specify your objectives   Alternatives Create Imaginative alternatives   Consequences Understand the consequences   Trade-offs Grapple with your trade-offs   Uncertainty Clarify your uncertainties   Risk tolerance Think hard about your risk tolerance   Linked decisions Consider linked decisions    Table 1. The PrOACT/URL approach to decision making by (Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa 2002).\nLess complex decisions might be accomplished following only the PrOACT process while more complex decisions include assessing uncertainties, risk tolerance of the decision maker and whether or not the decision is linked to other decisions. Adding these features is the source of the complete acronym, ‚ÄúProACT/URL.‚Äù\nDetailed discussions and reviews of MCDM are widely available (MCA; Keeney; von Winterfelt; others).A generalized process for muulticriteria decision analysis (MCDA), perhaps the most common methodology for MCDM, is given here:\n Identify and clearly define objectives Identify alternatives for achieving the objectives Identify the criteria and attributes to be used to compare the alternatives Analyze the alternatives and uncertainties: (‚Äúmodeling‚Äù the decision) Make choice or prioritize options Examine results and establish a follow-up period.  This general procedure has been slightly adapted for risk-focused prioritization used in projects i led or facilitated at FDA and NIH (Fig. 1).\n:\nUnderstanding the Objectives\r\r\r\r\rIt should come as no surprise that a group of experts who are diverse in their training and experience will perceive stated objectives differently. For nearly a century psychologists, decision scientists and economists have studied the inevitable intrusion of our subjective, perceiving minds into what is optimistically believed to be an objective decision making process (Kahneman 2011; Sunstein et al. 2002; Ariely 2009; Kahneman, Slovic, and Tversky 1982). Our internal processing of decision objectives is so individualized that we have trouble analyzing other perceptions among the the group. After a career‚Äôs worth of troubleshooting complex decisions and scholarship in decision analysis, Ralph Keeney recently recommend that groups not work through objectives and preference together until each member has defined the problem individually (Keeney 2013).\n:\nThe fundamental objectives of the decision capture the reason(s) we are deciding choosing among two or more alternatives (‚Äìsometimes known as choices; options). The fundamental objectives are no less important to a decision than are clearly stated and testable hypotheses to a high-quality research design. Even decisions in our personal lives have objectives that a perceived differently by individuals. For example, how many ways might an objective, ‚Äúachieve personal satisfaction in my career,‚Äù be perceived and defined among even a small number of individuals?\nPressure to Produce Tangible Results\r\r\r\r\rObjectives can be parsed into ‚Äúfundamental objectives‚Äù and ‚Äúmeans-ends objectives.‚Äù(Keeney 1992) The former captures the goal(s) of the decision while the latter states ways in which the goals might be achieved. For example, the fundamental objective of ‚Äúincrease supplier audits by 10%‚Äù could have an underlying means-end objectives, ‚Äúhire more auditing staff‚Äù and ‚Äúcontract more auditors.‚Äù These ‚Äúactionable‚Äù objectives are means to support the achievement of the fundamental objective of increasing audits. Often, the urge to produce ‚Äútangible results‚Äù for our an organization shifts the focus to defining means-ends objectives: asking an expert group (e.g.), ‚Äúhow do we evaluate information for the decision?‚Äù Certainly, it is possible to charge a working group with solving means-ends objectives-focused problem. But, if the group does not articulate the connections among the means-ends objectives with the overarching fundamental objectives, the decision will not likely be as robust as it would be otherwise.\nStructured Approaches?\r\r\r\r\rWhen Keeney wrote the paragraph (above) in 1992, he was correct in noting the lack of structured approaches for thinking critically through multicriteria decisions. Two decades later, we have witnessed an exponential growth in research and application of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) of which Keeney‚Äôs ‚Äúvalue-focused thinking‚Äù is one of the ‚Äúbest practices.‚Äù There are numerous examples of MCDA from the government and industry health care that translate efficiently to processes accessible to scientists and clinicians. The structured approaches are now available, and all that remains is the will to implement them. The will to implement MCDA will come from the realization that decision making is an acquired skill based on fundamental decision theory and practice. ‚ÄúBetter Blog Tools Create a post Manage posts Manage comments Launch blog program to post The Objectives: Making Decisions Matter - Risk and Decisions Blog Page 1 of 2 decision makers‚Äù come from practicing the learned skills.

To conduct the study, immediate-release ciprofloxacin tablets manufactured via roller compaction were used as a prototype system. Granules were manufactured using an Alexanderwerk WP120 roller compactor and tablets were compressed on a Stokes B2 tablet press. In the early stages of development, prior knowledge was systematically incorporated into the risk assessment using failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA). The factors identified using FMEA were then followed by a quantitative assessed using a Plackett‚ÄìBurman screening design. Results show that by using prior experience, literature data, and preformulation data the number of experiments could be reduced to an acceptable level, and the use of FMEA and screening designs such as the Plackett Burman can rationally guide the process of reducing the number experiments to a manageable level.","tags":["QRM","Quality Risk Management","Quality by Design"],"title":"Quality by design I: application of failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) and Plackett-Burman design of experiments in the identification of ‚Äúmain factors‚Äù in the formulation and process design space for roller-compacted ciprofloxacin hydrochloride immediate-release tablets.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

Two overarching principles for quality risk  management are that evaluations of risk should be scientifically based and ultimately linked to risk to the patient, and the level of effort and documentation of quality risk management processes should be commensurate with the level of risk. Numerous tools for risk management come from other applied sciences and manufacturing having a longer history of risk management. The degree of quantitative sophistication among tools varies from generalized and qualitative, ‚Äúhigh-level‚Äù tools to computationally rigorous, ‚Äúlow-level,‚Äù quantitative tools. Risk is described in recent guidance as a combination of the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm. Risk management always comes with uncertainty, given that it calls for  projections of the likelihood of adverse events for given severities. As a relatively new application of risk management, quality risk management can benefit from adapting existing theory and practice to pharmaceutical manufacturing.","tags":["QRM","FMEA","Risk management","uncertainty"],"title":"Perspective on Quality Risk Management of Pharmaceutical Quality","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

The assessment of potential human health risks posed by pathogens that have acquired resistance to antimicrobial drugs is a new application of risk assessment that is closely related to microbiological risk assessment. Antimicrobial resistance risk assessment is a risk analytical process that focuses on resistance determinants as hazardous agents that might lead to drug-resistant microbial infections in humans exposed to bacteria carrying the determinants. Antimicrobialresistant infections could occur directly from actively invading or opportunistic pathogens or indirectly from the transfer of resistance genes to other bacteria. Here, we discuss risk assessment models that might be employed to estimate risks from drug-resistant bacteria in the animal food pathway and the types of models and data that may be used for microbiological risk assessments or antimicrobial resistance risk assessments.","tags":["Risk assessment","Food safety","Antimicrobial resistance risk assessment"],"title":"Antimicrobial Resistance Risk Assessment in Food Safety","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

Although investigators often report artificially high levels of 8-OHGua in DNA samples that have been exposed to phenol solutions and/or air during processing, few quantitative results are available. We show that routine phenol-based DNA purification procedures can increase 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels 20-fold in samples that are exposed to air after the phenol is removed from the solutions. Surprisingly, air exposure alone accounts for a significant portion of this increase (4-fold) when compared to dG or DNA samples that have been solubilized in buffers purged with nitrogen. Most importantly, phenol treatments of DNA are shown to sensitize DNA to 8-OHdG formation by subsequent exposures to air. The sensitization of DNA occurs even though extensive dialysis is used between phenol treatment and enzymatic DNA digestion. Alternate procedures, including chlorofornrisoamyl-alcohol extractions, also yield air-sensitive DNA samples. Other artifacts of organic extraction prior to air exposure include alterations in DNA base ratios after nuclease digestions. Overall, these results strongly suggest that studies of 8-OHdG in carcinogenesis should avoid dry conditions, such as lyophilization followed by exposure to air, and that all four of the bases should be monitored before 8-OHdG concentrations are normalized by undamaged deoxynucleoside concentrations. Failure to heed these precautions can lead to 2- to 20-fold overestimates of 8-OHdG in target tissues or in vitro models.'","tags":["Risk assessment","DNA damage","Mutation"],"title":"Phenol sensitization of DNA to subsequent oxidative damage in 8-hydroxyguanine assays","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://gclaycamp.com/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
