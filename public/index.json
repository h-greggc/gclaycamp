In this post I compare quantitative features of\rCOVID-19 with H1N1 and other flu-like illnesses, Ebola virus disease (EVD), and SARS to show differences between COVID-19 and the flu. Of course, this is not the first time these comparisons have been made in public media; rather, this post is only my perspective on the issue.\nThere are several ways in which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and some recent other pandemics can be compared. Sometimes, the endpoints for comparing the pandemic are cherry-picked to support the individual’s or organization’s purpose. But generally speaking, quantitative comparisons of pandemics begin using fundamental measures, such as\nthe number of cases,\rthe number of deaths, and\rthe population size.\rAlthough these pandemic measures start with the seemingly simple process of counting cases and deaths, the luxury of that simplicity is seldom achievable. Each numerical comparison is nuanced and sometimes even specific to which outbreak of complex disease. The field of epidemiology–the study of diseases in populations–uses these fundamental measures to derive more specific measures of incidence, prevalence, and risk (Below). Trained infectious disease scientists and clinicians seldom made casual comparisons using only the above terms, but instead, carefully state the assumptions and possibly caveats necessary to make scientifically valid comparisons using an array of terms. For this post, we’ll assume that such simplifying assumptions and caveats could be easily resolved.\nComparing the number of cases\rThe number of cases (“case counts”) is a basic measure used to routinely monitor diseases in addition to detecting an emerging epidemic disease.1 The following figure (Fig.1) shows the worldwide case counts for the past SARS, EVD and H1N1 (Swine Flu) outbreaks and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Note that the horizontal axis is a logarithmic scale, e.g., moving in powers of 10 (10, 100, 1000, 10000, …). If not shown that way, the tens of millions of cases in COVID-19 and H1N1 would visually swamp the thousands-fold fewer cases of Ebola and SARS. (You would need a very wide monitor to display the graph!)\nDeath Counts Tell a Different Story\rThe total deaths due to the outbreaks are shown in Fig. 2. Here I dropped the log scale to show the dramatic differences among the past and ongoing outbreaks. For example, the SARS outbreak from a coronavirus, disappears as a significant cause of worldwide mortality.\nThe data reported during and after an outbreak is likely to include the proportion of cases or deaths in the population. Sometimes these proportions are called the “normalized cases (or deaths).” At the simplest level, these proportions are simply the number of cases/deaths divided by the size of the population of concern. Because populations of interest in epidemiology are often large, the ratio is adjusted to the “number of cases/deaths per 100,000 in the population.” For example, if we found 200 cases in a population of 250,000 people, the normalized cases are:\n\\[ N^*=\\frac{200 \\ cases}{250,000 \\ people}=0.0008\r\\]\rThis mathematical result, while certainly correct, leaves us with trying to imagine a 0.0008 illness. Thus, we can bring the proportion back to the realm of whole people by multiplying the proportion by 100,000:\n\\[\rn^*=0.0008 \\ times \\ 100000 = 80\\ cases \\ per \\ 100,000 \\ people\r\\]\r“Normalizing” the case/death counts by population size makes sense for the comparison of the intensity of an outbreak from one administrative boundary to the next. For example, if the administrative boundary is \u0026#34; county\u0026#34; and the example is compared with a second county also having 200 cases of disease but a population size of 1M, then the normalized comparison is 80 versus 20 cases per 100,000. Clearly, the counties that were apparently equal in case counts now are 4-fold different in the normalized case counts.\nHigher Order Measures in Outbreaks\rThe base counts are seldom sufficient for making comparisons among outbreaks and pandemics. For example, if we look at only total case counts, then we have only a cumulative counting measure that begins at the index (first) case and ends some period of time later when no new cases are observed. But the rate of accumulation of new cases might be more relevant to public health planning because it informs the rate at which health services will be needed for case management. There are several higher order or derived measures of an outbreak that are more useful for understanding not only the population disease process itself, but also the possible demand on health care resources. Such derived measures include, among others:\nincidence (incidence rate; …","date":1597708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622645669,"objectID":"6d988c44034ce4bd1a8547b34ed68977","permalink":"https://www.gclaycamp.com/post/covid-not-flu/covid-not-flu/","publishdate":"2020-08-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/covid-not-flu/covid-not-flu/","section":"post","summary":"The coronavirus pandemic of COVID-19 is often compared with recent pandemics and then casually dismissed as being \\\"no worse than the flu.\\\" I disuss some of the striking differences that should get and keep our attention for the health of the nation and the globe.","tags":null,"title":"COVID-19 is Not Just Like the Annual Flu","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["MCDA","QRM"],"content":"","date":1597708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622645669,"objectID":"5f37b2ad333bcfb71c4c7d40cc51edf4","permalink":"https://www.gclaycamp.com/post/2020-08-18-the-basics-of-mcda-part-1/the-basics-of-mcda-part-1/","publishdate":"2020-08-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-08-18-the-basics-of-mcda-part-1/the-basics-of-mcda-part-1/","section":"post","summary":"Multi-criteria decision analysis is a collection of tools that can help individuals and teams to make better decisions","tags":"MCDA","title":"The Basics of MCDA","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556323200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657203652,"objectID":"cc10135732d4dd26f4a52eaaddf8e4de","permalink":"https://www.gclaycamp.com/project/qrm-tools/","publishdate":"2019-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/qrm-tools/","section":"project","summary":"A Few Excel and R tools for Quality Risk Management.

Although risk is generally a probability of loss of something of value, given that a risk-generating event will occur or has occurred, it is ironic that the quality risk management literature and guidelines on quality risk management tools are relatively silent on the meaning and uses of “probability.” The probability concept is typically applied by risk managers as a combination of data-based, “frequentist” measures of probability and a Bayesian, “degree of belief” meaning of probability.  Probability as a concept that is crucial for understanding and managing risk is discussed though examples from the most general, scenario-defining and ranking tools that use probability implicitly to more specific probabilistic tools in risk management.  A rich history of probability in risk management applied to other fields suggests that high-quality risk management decisions benefit from the implementation of probability concepts in both risk modeling and risk management.","tags":["QRM","Quality Risk Management","Uncertainty"],"title":"Probability Concepts in Quality Risk Management","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1524787200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620991912,"objectID":"3b96c2a8c564b4e0fd13a3b06fdab1b7","permalink":"https://www.gclaycamp.com/project/website-1/","publishdate":"2018-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/website-1/","section":"project","summary":"A WordPress (.org) website created for my church.","tags":["Other","website"],"title":"Prince of Peace Lutheran Church","type":"project"},{"authors":["John C.

For both studies, the microclimate, atomization pressure, inlet air volume, product temperature (during spraying and curing), curing time, and percent solids in the coating solutions were studied. The responses evaluated were percent agglomeration, percent fines, percent yield, bead aspect ratio, median particle size diameter (d50), assay, and drug release rate.

Validated models were used to monitor and control batches manufactured at different sites to assess their robustness to change. The results showed that roll pressure (RP) and CFt played a critical role in the quality of the granules and the finished product within the range tested. Replacing binder source did not statistically influence the quality attributes of the granules and tablets. However, lubricant type has significantly impacted the granule size. Blend uniformity, crushing force, disintegration time during the manufacturing was predicted using validated PLS regression models with acceptable standard error of prediction (SEP) values, whereas the models resulted in higher SEP for batches obtained from different manufacturing site.

Quantitative risk assessment methods in design and operational spaces are a significant aid to evaluating proposed design space boundaries. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate a relatively simple strategy for design space definition using a simplified Bayesian Monte Carlo simulation. This paper builds on a previous paper that used failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) qualitative risk assessment and Plackett-Burman design of experiments to identity the critical quality attributes. The results show that the sequential use of qualitative and quantitative risk assessments can focus the design of experiments on a reduced set of critical material and process parameters that determine a robust design space under conditions of limited laboratory experimentation. This approach provides a strategy by which the degree of risk associated with each known parameter can be calculated and allocates resources in a manner that manages risk to an acceptable level.","tags":["QRM","Quality Risk Management","Quality by Design"],"title":"Quality-by-Design II: Application of Quantitative Risk Analysis to the Formulation of Ciprofloxacin Tablets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raafat Fahmy","Ravikanth Kona","Ramesh Dandu","Walter Xie","Gregg Claycamp","Stephen W.

Thus, the objective of this study is to examine how quality risk management can be used to prioritize the number of experiments needed to identify the CQA, while still maintaining an acceptable product risk profile. To conduct the study, immediate-release ciprofloxacin tablets manufactured via roller compaction were used as a prototype system. Granules were manufactured using an Alexanderwerk WP120 roller compactor and tablets were compressed on a Stokes B2 tablet press. In the early stages of development, prior knowledge was systematically incorporated into the risk assessment using failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA). The factors identified using FMEA were then followed by a quantitative assessed using a Plackett–Burman screening design. Results show that by using prior experience, literature data, and preformulation data the number of experiments could be reduced to an acceptable level, and the use of FMEA and screening designs such as the Plackett Burman can rationally guide the process of reducing the number experiments to a manageable level.","tags":["QRM","Quality Risk Management","Quality by Design"],"title":"Quality by design I: application of failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) and Plackett-Burman design of experiments in the identification of “main factors” in the formulation and process design space for roller-compacted ciprofloxacin hydrochloride immediate-release tablets.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

Two overarching principles for quality risk  management are that evaluations of risk should be scientifically based and ultimately linked to risk to the patient, and the level of effort and documentation of quality risk management processes should be commensurate with the level of risk. Numerous tools for risk management come from other applied sciences and manufacturing having a longer history of risk management. The degree of quantitative sophistication among tools varies from generalized and qualitative, “high-level” tools to computationally rigorous, “low-level,” quantitative tools. Risk is described in recent guidance as a combination of the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm. Risk management always comes with uncertainty, given that it calls for  projections of the likelihood of adverse events for given severities. As a relatively new application of risk management, quality risk management can benefit from adapting existing theory and practice to pharmaceutical manufacturing.","tags":["QRM","FMEA","Risk management","uncertainty"],"title":"Perspective on Quality Risk Management of Pharmaceutical Quality","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

The assessment of potential human health risks posed by pathogens that have acquired resistance to antimicrobial drugs is a new application of risk assessment that is closely related to microbiological risk assessment. Antimicrobial resistance risk assessment is a risk analytical process that focuses on resistance determinants as hazardous agents that might lead to drug-resistant microbial infections in humans exposed to bacteria carrying the determinants. Antimicrobialresistant infections could occur directly from actively invading or opportunistic pathogens or indirectly from the transfer of resistance genes to other bacteria. Here, we discuss risk assessment models that might be employed to estimate risks from drug-resistant bacteria in the animal food pathway and the types of models and data that may be used for microbiological risk assessments or antimicrobial resistance risk assessments.","tags":["Risk assessment","Food safety","Antimicrobial resistance risk assessment"],"title":"Antimicrobial Resistance Risk Assessment in Food Safety","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

Although investigators often report artificially high levels of 8-OHGua in DNA samples that have been exposed to phenol solutions and/or air during processing, few quantitative results are available. We show that routine phenol-based DNA purification procedures can increase 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels 20-fold in samples that are exposed to air after the phenol is removed from the solutions. Surprisingly, air exposure alone accounts for a significant portion of this increase (4-fold) when compared to dG or DNA samples that have been solubilized in buffers purged with nitrogen. Most importantly, phenol treatments of DNA are shown to sensitize DNA to 8-OHdG formation by subsequent exposures to air. The sensitization of DNA occurs even though extensive dialysis is used between phenol treatment and enzymatic DNA digestion. Alternate procedures, including chlorofornrisoamyl-alcohol extractions, also yield air-sensitive DNA samples. Other artifacts of organic extraction prior to air exposure include alterations in DNA base ratios after nuclease digestions. Overall, these results strongly suggest that studies of 8-OHdG in carcinogenesis should avoid dry conditions, such as lyophilization followed by exposure to air, and that all four of the bases should be monitored before 8-OHdG concentrations are normalized by undamaged deoxynucleoside concentrations. Failure to heed these precautions can lead to 2- to 20-fold overestimates of 8-OHdG in target tissues or in vitro models.'","tags":["Risk assessment","DNA damage","Mutation"],"title":"Phenol sensitization of DNA to subsequent oxidative damage in 8-hydroxyguanine assays","type":"publication"}]
